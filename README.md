## 📖 About The Project

**Yagi** is an advanced **End-to-End Data Lakehouse & MLOps** system designed for real-time natural disaster warning. This project serves as a comprehensive case study based on the historic **Super Typhoon Yagi (2024)**.

By leveraging **Lambda Architecture** and **Containerization**, Yagi demonstrates how modern Big Data systems ingest, process, store, and analyze massive streams of sensor data to provide life-saving early warnings.

### ❓ Why Yagi?
During Typhoon Yagi, traditional warning systems faced latency and scalability issues. Yagi solves this by:
*   **Streaming First:** Processing data as it arrives (Speed Layer).
*   **ACID Transactions:** Ensuring data integrity with Delta Lake.
*   **ML Integration:** Predicting wind speed and storm trajectory using AI.
*   **Resilience:** Designed to survive infrastructure failures (Chaos Engineering ready).

---

## 🏗 Architecture

The system follows a modernized **Lambda Architecture**, optimized for resource-constrained environments (e.g., 16GB RAM):

| Layer | Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ingestion** | **Apache Kafka (KRaft)** | High-throughput message buffer. Zookeeper-less for efficiency. |
| **Speed Layer** | **Spark Streaming** | Real-time processing and immediate hazard detection. |
| **Batch/Serving** | **MinIO + Delta Lake** | Durable storage with Time Travel capabilities. |
| **Intelligence** | **MLOps (Docker/Colab)** | Training models on historical data and deploying inference services. |
| **Visualization** | **Streamlit** | Real-time dashboard for monitoring wind speed and pressure. |

---

## ✨ Features

- **Data Replay Engine**: Simulates IoT sensors transmitting typhoon data from historical CSV logs with adjustable speed.
- **Delta Lake Integration**: Transactional storage layer for reliable Data Lake operations.
- **Real-time Inference**: Dockerized Python service consuming live Kafka streams to predict storm intensity.
- **Auto-Healing**: Capable of recovering from service failures (tested via Chaos Engineering).
- **Multi-channel Alerts**: Instant notifications via Telegram API when critical thresholds are breached.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites

*   **Docker Desktop** (Engine 20.10+)
*   **Python 3.9+**
*   **Git**

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repo**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/EurusDevSec/Yagi.git
    cd Yagi
    ```

2.  **Environment Setup**
    Create a `.env` file (if required) or configure `docker-compose.yaml` as needed. The default configuration is optimized for local development.

3.  **Start Services**
    Launch the infrastructure using Docker Compose:
    ```sh
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
    *Wait for a few minutes for Kafka and MinIO to initialize fully.*

4.  **Verify Status**
    Check if all containers are healthy:
    ```sh
    docker ps
    ```

---

## 🎮 Usage

### 1. Ingest Data (Simulate Typhoon)
Run the producer script to start replaying the Yagi typhoon data into Kafka:
```sh
python jobs/yagi_producer.py
```

### 2. Start Processing (Spark)
Submit the Spark Streaming job to process the stream and write to Delta Lake:
```sh
docker exec -it spark-master spark-submit --packages io.delta:delta-core_2.12:2.4.0 /jobs/spark_ingestion.py
```

### 3. Launch Dashboard
Access the Streamlit dashboard to view real-time metrics:
```sh
streamlit run dashboard/app.py
```
*Open your browser at `http://localhost:8501`*
